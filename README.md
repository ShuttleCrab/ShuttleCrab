- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ShuttleCrab
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cyber security and web development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning both cyber security and web development, as one day, I wish to persue a career in the penetration testing.

- I'll be using this repo as a means of accessing my learning materials, reviewing/documenting progress and re-capping even if I'm away from the home set up.
- On top of this, it's a way to get to grips with github and offer a way to show case any projects I begin.
